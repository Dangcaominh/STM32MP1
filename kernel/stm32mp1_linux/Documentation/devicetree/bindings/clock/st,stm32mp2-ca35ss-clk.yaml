description: |
  This binding describes the clock controller provided by the secure monitor
  (TF-A BL31) which supplies the clock for the Cortex-A35 subsystem (CA35SS).
  The clock controller uses SMC calls for frequency scaling.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: "st,stm32mp2-ca35ss-clk"

  "#clock-cells":
    const: 0

required:
  - compatible
  - "#clock-cells"

additionalProperties: false

      ca35ss_clk: ca35ss-clk {
        compatible = "st,stm32mp2-ca35ss-clk";
        #clock-cells = <0>;
